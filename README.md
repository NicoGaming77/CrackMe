# CrackMe

**A "crackme" reverse engineering challenge is a type of puzzle designed to test one's skills in reverse engineering and software analysis.**\
\
There is a password hidden within each of the compiled binaries, and the levels get harder with each challenge.\
The executables are compiled for windows but the source code has been provided so you can compile them for other operating systems.\
There are no anti-debugger tricks in place.\
\
*Note: Looking at the source code will reveal both the password and how the password is hidden*


### Levels

<ol>
<li>Plaintext password</li>
<li>Testing individual characters</li>
<li>Simple string manipulation</li>
<li>Using XOR to hide the password</li>
<li>Encrypting the password</li>
<li>Password is generated at runtime</li>
</ol>

Good luck!
